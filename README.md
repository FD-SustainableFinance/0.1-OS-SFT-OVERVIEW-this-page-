# [0.1] OS-SFT HISTORY

## Background - July, 2021
The project has its origins in July, 2021 when [Johnny Mattimore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnny-d-mattimore-082969136/) - through his role at First Derivative as MD, Global Head of Risk and Sustainable Finance - was exploring with market colleagues the problem of sourcing carbon emissions data. Johnny had a concept that *"we are living through a fundamental change in business practices and that this will impact the price of every asset on the planet"*. Based on this, he set about researching how best to go beyond carbon emissions and address the wider data problem across sustainable finance (**SF**), including the domains of Climate Change and ESG. The problem kept returning to "data" in its holistic sense - what data, how is it defined, how many types of data, how to find it, how to make it ready for use by financial services firms ... on and on.

The small group of colleagues understood from prior data problems that the only logical way forward was to give this overwhelming data problem some boundary conditions so that it was more manageable. To do this, we decided to focus on an open-source agenda to provide access to the foundation taxonomies that would enable everyone to make progress on developing and integrating these new data models. Moreover, we decided to do it in small, incremental steps - to build a library of taxonomies for all to use. In summary, we agreed that one cannot begin to address the data problem without addressing the foundations of robust science-based and mathematics-based taxonomies. Then we could make progress in small steps, then rinse-and-repeat, with many contributors until we had a huge libary of sound taxonomies for all to use for free.

Such taxonomies are the bedrock of any use case, or business problem, because without a robust, scientific definition of data classification (called "[taxonomies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy)"), nothing downstream can work - all reporting functions, all lines of business and all group functions would fail on their **sustainable finance mandates** without this foundation. 

On this premise, we set our **vision** to develop an **open-source project for sustainable finance taxonomies** that would help to **drive faster changes** in sustainable finance across the entire global financial system.

Following on from this vision, and inspired by the work of other financial open-source initiatives like [FINOS](https://www.finos.org/) and [OS-Climate](https://os-climate.org/), we embarked on a mission to gather like-minded collaborators to create a critical mass of partners to be able to launch this site.

## Initial Funding - November, 2021
As with all projects of this nature, we needed a catalyst. This was provided in November, 2021 by the vision and generosity of the Irish Government through its specialist grant department, [Sustainable Finance Skillnet](https://sfskillnet.sustainablefinance.ie/) (SF Skillnet), in partnership with [Sustainable Finance Ireland](https://www.sustainablefinance.ie/) (SFI). See [SF Skillnet Funding Press Release](https://www.sustainablefinance.ie/2021/11/03/sustainable-finance-ireland-provides-funding-for-ground-breaking-esg-data-project-to-first-derivative-and-corlytics/)

The funding from SF Skillnet allowed First Derivative and Corlytics to embark on a series of research sprints to develop a plan along with initial research output to set a target for an open-source taxonomy project to benefit all.

## Site Launch - October, 2022
Within one year of our vision and initial funding, we had assembled a group of like-minded partners with the commitment to design, build and maintain a site that we hope will benefit all humankind. We launched the site from Ireland where the support for sustainable finance is extraordinary from the Irish Government, international organisations and the private sector. The site immediately expanded to have a global impact with contributions from partners in multiple jurisdictions.

## The Future - January, 2023+
Above all, the site aims to be a practical resource pool for all actors that are active in integrating sustainable finance into the financial services sector. So, the objective for 2023 and beyond, is to keep true to our foundation principles, following our “North Star” of always providing practical tools to create taxonomies for the data that is necessary to **measure, monitor and manage all facets of sustainability** now and in the future.
